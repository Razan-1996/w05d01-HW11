**[Ruby on Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/)**
- Apply your knowledge of Ruby on rails to answer these questions.

## Questions
1. What is Active Record?
Active Record is the M in MVC - the model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic. 

2. What is MVC?
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components Model, View, and Controller. 

3. What is REST-ful routing?
is a route that provides mapping between HTTP verbs (get, post, put, delete, patch) to controller CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete). Instead of relying solely on the URL to indicate what site to visit, a RESTful route also depends on the HTTP verb and the URL.

4. What are migration files and why do we need them?
Migrations are files, which are responsible for making any changes in the database. They can create or drop a table, add or remove a column, modify it, add an index or rename it or do plenty of different thing. They can also contain a code which makes some changes in the existing data, for example, update it or remove records which are invalid.

They help you to evolve your database schema over time without a problem. They convert a Ruby code into a SQL code, so you don’t even write a single line of SQL code.

5. What does the `rails routes` do?
recognizes URLs and dispatches them to a controller's action, or to a Rack application. It can also generate paths and URLs, avoiding the need to hardcode strings in your views.
